This example is a little, but working CSV-over-HTTP server.
Add all files to an HTTP-server and add this server to Silverjuke using
"Settings / Music library / Add source".

For more information about the CSV-over-HTTP technique, please refer to
"Help / All files" in Silverjuke or to 
https://github.com/r10s/silverjuke/blob/master/docs/csv-over-http.md
