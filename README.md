Silverjuke SDK Examples
================================================================================

In this repository, you'll find some scripts and programs that can be used as
templates to build your own Silverjuke add-ons.

For some **Scripting Examples**, please refer to the "scripts" folder. To get an
overview about the SDK, see the SDK documentation (Offline at "Help / All files"
in the Silverjuke program or online at https://github.com/r10s/silverjuke/tree/master/docs )

To start with the **C-Plugin-Interface**, please have a look at the
"hello_world" and other examples.  The plugin examples were tested with
Visual C++ (project files are included), but should work with other compilers as
well.

If you need information about the Silverjue jukebox itself, please refer to

BTW: Silverjuke and these Examples are available under the GPL open source
license.  Any user contributions are welcome!
